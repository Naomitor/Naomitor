- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning to code. 
- To get me started I decided to set the goal to write a program that can calculate the possibilites and results of any dice set thrown.
- I first started to write it in Python while very easy to start it was slow and the limited multithreading lead me to C++.
- ThatÂ´s what iÂ´m working with right now and hope to finish this project with
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning to program in C++ and Pyhton
